# Thesis
Code documentation for the thesis titled "On Intrinsic Dimensionality of Data Sets and Neural Networks" submitted to the Air Force Institute of Technology in the Operations Research department, class of March 24'

The code presented is one of many almost identical Jupyter notebooks used for the research on which my thesis was based. The specific code was used for analyzing the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set which, as all other data sets used, was downloaded from Kaggle.

A full list of data sets used for the research, all well-known benchmark data sets used in machine learning:
1. Wisconsin Breast Cancer
2. Sonar
3. Pima Indian Diabetes
4. Banknote
5. Ionosphere
6. NBA
7. Cleveland Heart Disease (the binary version of the data set where it is simply indicated whether the patient had heart disease)
8. Iris
9. Wheat Seeds
10. Wine Quality - used for binary classification for scores of up to 5 and 6 or above (division chosen to maximize class balance)
11. Wine Quality - used for three class classification for scores of up to 5, 6 and 7 or above (division chosen to maximize class balance)
12. Boston House Price - used for binary classification for prices below or above median (division chosen to maximize class balance)
13. Boston House Price - used for three class classification for prices in the lower, middle or upper thirds (division chosen to maximize class balance)
14. Abalone - used for binary classification for ages below or above median (division chosen to maximize class balance)
15. Abalone - used for three class classification for ages in the lower, middle or upper thirds (division chosen to maximize class balance)
